Amaze CoolWall
====================

Internal (and ultimately unrealised) project to implement an interactive Top Gear 
style "Cool Wall" to allow Amaze staff to set up, conduct and record the results
of surveys for the [Amaze Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uikMZvPfsEY) project.

Front-end built using Backbone Boilerplate and back-end stubbed out in node with Express.
